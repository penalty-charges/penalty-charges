        <li> <em> You are entitled to NHS free prescriptions </em> </li>
        <p>  You might like to refer to the other side of this leaflet to help you work out if you are entitled to free NHS prescriptions. </p>
        <li> <em> You have a valid in date certificate </em> </li>
        <p> An example of a certificate that entitles you to free NHS prescriptions is a HC2 form. These are for people on low incomes. </p>
        <li> <em> You have a prepayment certificate </em> </li>
        <p> These certificates are evidence that you have already paid a fee up front in order to receive prescriptions. It means you do not have to pay every time you go to collect a prescription. </p>
        <li> Even if none of the above reasons (1-3) apply to you, you might be able to tell the NHS that you have <em> exceptional reasons </em> not to pay.</li>
        <p> <strong> What are exceptional reasons? </strong> </p>
        <p> An exceptional reason could be a number of things. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>English is not your first language so you were genuinely confused as to which box to tick on the prescription. You should send a copy of benefit letter- clarify with Sharan.</li>
          <li>You could not read the prescription form due to illiteracy.</li>
          <li> You suffer with a mental health condition which affected your ability to understand which box to tick on the prescription.</li>
          <li>You were on Contribution-based Employment Support Allowance (ESA) but it was unreasonable for you to understand whether you were on Contribution-based ESA or Income Related ESA.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
